# Helmholtz-decomposition
This is an example of how to perform the Helmholtz decomposition in velocity fields from an OGCM using the windspharm package.

You'll need, of course, the windspharm package! And you can see the documentation here: https://ajdawson.github.io/windspharm/latest/

It can give you the following quantities:
  - divergence
  - vorticity (relative and absolute)
  - streamfunction
  - velocity potential
  - irrotational and non-divergent components of the wind (Helmholtz decomposition)
  - vector gradient of a scalar function
  - triangular truncation of a scalar field
  - magnitude of wind speed

It is useful for both oceanic and atmospheric data!
Enjoy :)
